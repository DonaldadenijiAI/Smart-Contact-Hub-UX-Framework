## 1. Executive Summary
SmartContactHub is an OS-native UX framework that empowers users to manage relationshipsâ€”not just contacts. It unifies communication logs, intelligently filters notifications, and introduces lightweight CRM tools within the dialer itself.

## 2. The Problem
Current mobile OS designs force users into fragmented experiences:
- Notification fatigue from 3rd party apps

Introduce a **Smart Contact/Relationship Hub** at the OS level:
- Tabs for Recents, IQ, Connections, and CRM

- Microinteractions to reply or engage directly from log
- Context-aware, privacy-first notification filtering

## 4. Key UX Concepts
- OS-level control: not another app permission gate
